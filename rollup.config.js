/**
 * Just a few details about this build implementation:
 * - Uses `rollup` along with `rollup-plugin-typescript2` to build to two target files
 * (`index.es.js` and `index.cjs.js`). This means that there is only a *single* file now for each
 * target rather than 4 files (ie. `index.js`, `chain.js`, etc.).
 * - Rollup has their own official @rollup/plugin-typescript plugin but it does not have the best
 * TS declarations support atm (see https://github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/394,
 * https://github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/254, https://github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/243).
 * Until these are resolved, I choose to just use `rollup-plugin-typescript2`.
 * - `rollup-plugin-typescript2` generates `index.d.ts`, `chain.d.ts`, `result.d.ts` and
 * `result-async.d.ts` but this is inconsistent with the generated JavaScript files. This isn't a
 * huge issues unless someone tries to import `errok/dist/chain` which would error
 * because the underlying `.js` doesn't exist. To remedy this issue, I used `rollup-plugin-dts` to
 * merge `*.d.ts` files into a single `index.d.ts`.
 * - It's unfortunately a bit complicated to generate two build outputs but once some of the
 * issues I've linked to above are resolved this process will become much easier :)
 * - Because the build process is kinda two steps (first using `rollup-plugin-typescript2` and then
 * using `rollup-plugin-dts`), I first write to `tmp/`, then write the merged `index.d.ts` to
 * `dist/` and then moved `index.es.js` and `index.cjs.js` to `dist/`.
